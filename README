The Darshan source tree is divided into two parts:

- darshan-runtime: configure and install on systems where you intend to 
  instrument MPI applications

- darshan-util: configure and install on systems where you intend to analyze
  log files produced by darshan-runtime

For installation instructions please visit

The darshan-test directory contains various test harnesses, benchmarks,
patches, and unsupported utilites that are mainly of interest to Darshan
developers.
