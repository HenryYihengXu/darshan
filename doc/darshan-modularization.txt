Darshan modularization branch development notes
===============================================

== Introduction

Darshan is a lightweight toolkit for characterizing the I/O performance of instrumented
HPC applications.

Darshan was originally designed to gather I/O data from a static set of sources.
Adding instrumentation for additional sources of I/O data was only possible through
manual modification of the Darshan log file format, which consequentially breaks
any other utilities reliant on that format.

Starting with version 3.0.0, the Darshan runtime environment and log file format have
been redesigned such that new "instrumentation modules" can be added without breaking
existing tools. Developers are given a framework to implement arbitrary instrumentation
modules, which are responsible for gathering I/O data from a specific system component
(which could be from an I/O library, platform-specific data, etc.). Darshan can then
manage these modules at runtime and create a valid Darshan log regardless of how many
or what types of modules are used.

== Checking out and building the modularization branch

Developers can clone the Darshan source repository using the following methods:

* "git clone git://git.mcs.anl.gov/radix/darshan" (read-only access)

* "git clone \git@git.mcs.anl.gov:radix/darshan" (authenticated access)

After cloning the Darshan source, it is necessary to checkout the modularization
development branch:

----
git clone git@git.mcs.anl.gov:radix/darshan
git checkout dev-modular
----

For details on configuring and building the Darshan runtime and utility repositories,
consult the documentation from previous versions
(http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/darshan/docs/darshan-runtime.html[darshan-runtime] and
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/darshan/docs/darshan-util.html[darshan-util]) -- the
necessary steps for building these repositories should not have changed in the new version of
Darshan.

== Architectural overview

The Darshan source tree is composed of two primary components:

* *darshan-runtime*: Darshan runtime environment necessary for instrumenting MPI
applications and generating I/O characterization logs.

* *darshan-util*: Darshan utilities for analyzing the contents of a given Darshan
I/O characterization log.

The following subsections provide an overview of each of these components with specific
attention to how new instrumentation modules may be integrated into Darshan.

=== darshan-runtime

At a high level, the darshan-runtime library is responsible for instrumenting MPI applications
and generating a log file containing the resulting I/O characterization.

The I/O behavior an application is primarily instrumented by intercepting function calls of
interest and recording relevant data.

// TODO: how does dynamic vs static executable affect a module developer?
