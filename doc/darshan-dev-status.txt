Darshan-modular branch development notes
========================================

== Introduction

Darshan-modular is the new implementation of Darshan (version >= 3.0.0), a lightweight
toolkit for characterizing the I/O performance of instrumented HPC applications.

Previously, Darshan had been designed to gather I/O data from a static set of sources.
Adding instrumentation for additional sources of I/O data was only possible through
manual modification of the Darshan log file format, which consequentially breaks
other utilities reliant on that format.

Darshan-modular is differentiated from previous versions in that it modularizes the Darshan
runtime environment and log file format such that new "instrumentation modules" can be
added without breaking existing tools. Essentially, developers are given a framework to
implement arbitrary modules, which are responsible for gathering I/O data from a specific
system component (which could be from an I/O library, platform-specific data, etc.). Darshan
can then manage these modules and create a valid Darshan log regardless of how many or what
types of modules are used.
