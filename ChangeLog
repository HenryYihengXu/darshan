Darshan Release Change Log
--------------------------

darshan-1.1.9
=============
* Added "fast" version of each BG/P compiler
* Added experimental scripts in test directory to run fsstats in parallel
* Kevin Harms: Added experimental utilities for loading darshan results into SQL
* Use exclusive flag when opening output file (to protect against file name collision)
* Rob Ross: updates to allow command line tools to build on Darwin
* Bug fix for pnetcdf configure problem reported by Rob Latham; darshan now always pulls in MPI_Wtime() symbol at link time

darshan-1.1.8
=============
* Added tracking of file system type and mount point for each file
* Added tracking of file size at open time (CP_SIZE_AT_OPEN)
* Moved sync cost to be counted in cumulative write time rather than cumulative metadata time
* Added sync as a separate category in darshan-job-summar.pl counters
* Bug fix to most frequent access size table in darshan-job-summary.pl
* Converted all utilities to use darshan-logutils api for reading output files
* Added backwards compatibility to darshan-logutils routines
* Kevin Harms: Added darshan-analyzer utility to summarize usage of MPI-IO, pNetCDF, HDF5, and shared files across a set of output files
* Fixed bug field listing for darshan-diff utility

darshan-1.1.7
=============
* Minor fix for a compile warning

darshan-1.1.6
=============
* Kevin Harms: bug fix for segfault in apps that use MPI_Init_thread()

darshan-1.1.5
=============
* Limit PMPI usage in library to fewer functions
* Update PMPI detection in compiler scripts to ignore functions unused by Darshan

darshan-1.1.4
=============
* Track files opened via Parallel NetCDF
* Track files opened via HDF5
* Record slowest individual POSIX read and write times along with access size for those operations
* Inspect symbols at compile time to determine whether to enable Darshan or not based on the presence of MPI and PMPI symbols
* Use GNU and IBM compilers from path rather than hard coded location
* Simplify warning message if unable to open log file
* Remove unused internal benchmark routines

darshan-1.1.3
=============
* Updated compiler scripts for V1R4 driver on BlueGene/P

darshan-1.1.2
=============
* Added *_r versions of each IBM compiler script on BlueGene/P

darshan-1.1.1
=============
* Set default permissions to 0400 (user read only) for output files
* Automatically disable Darshan at link time if common PMPI libraries are detected in the command line
* Experimental tool (darshan-gen-cc.pl) to automatically generate Darshan-enabled mpicc scripts

darshan-1.1.0
=============
* Initial public release
