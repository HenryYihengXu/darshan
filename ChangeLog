Darshan Release Change Log
--------------------------

darshan-2.1.2
=============
* bug fix contributed by Sandra Schr√∂der: use case-insensitive search for MPI
  symbols in Fortran wrapper script

darshan-2.1.1
=============
* added --with-logpath-by-env configure option to allow absolute 
  log path to be specified via environment variable

darshan-2.1.0
=============
* additinoal environment variables to control log, jobid and
  alignment parameters
* additional configure tests to improve portability
* bug fixes for darshan-parser --perf calucations
* support for MPI1.x
* support for OpenMPI
* support for PGI, Intel compilers
* new libdarshan.so dynamic library for use with LD_PRELOAD

darshan-2.0.2
=============
* added a random identifier to job logs (to avoid collisions from multiple
  application instances within a single scheduler job)
* improved installation and library path management for darshan-job-summary.pl
* improved error handling in darshan-job-summary.pl
* additional derived statistics categories for darshan-parser output:
    --all   : all sub-options are enabled
    --base  : darshan log field data [default]
    --file  : total file counts
    --perf  : derived perf data
    --total : aggregated darshan field data

darshan-2.0.1
=============
* bug fix to variance/minimum calculations on shared files
* switch to automatic generation of all MPI compiler scripts using
  darshan-gen-* tools
* new run time environment variable: DARSHAN_INTERNAL_TIMING.  If set at job
  execution time, it will cause Darshan to time its own internal data 
  aggregation routines and print the results to stdout at rank 0.

darshan-2.0.0
=============
* new output file format that is portable across architectures
  NOTE: Darshan 1.x output files are incompatible with the tools in this 
  release unless they were generated on a ppc32 architecture (Blue Gene)
* 8 new counters that record the rank of the fastest and slowest process that
  opened each shared file, along with the number of seconds and number of
  bytes consumed by those processes.  It also reports the variance in both
  time and amount of data.
* new --with-jobid-env configure argument to support recording job identifiers
  from different schedulers
* job ID is now recorded within the Darshan log in addition to in the file
  name
* darshan-job-summary.pl:
  * opens output files directly without using intermediate darshan-parser output
  * table showing data usage per file system
  * table showing I/O variance in shared files
* Fixes for bugs reported by Noah Watkins: 
  * avoid name collision in hashing function
  * divide by zero error in darshan-job-summary.pl

darshan-1.1.14
==============
* fixed erroneous incompatibility warning when opening old logs in darshan-parser

darshan-1.1.13
==============
* updated compiler scripts to fix link order in some cases with -lhdf5

darshan-1.1.12
==============
* improved mapping of file records to mount points
* new page in darshan-job-summary.pl output showing timelines of file access
* bug fix to "fast" mpif90 script
* checkpoint/restart ability in parallel fsstats script

darshan-1.1.11
==============
* Bug fix for lseek, pread, and pwrite when used in 32 applications without large file support
* Improved experimental darshan-gen-cc.pl script
* Added new experimental darshan-gen-cxx.pl script

darshan-1.1.10
==============
* Bug fix for files that are accessed with stat() but never opened
* Workaround zlib problems with 64 bit offsets on 32 bit architectures

darshan-1.1.9
=============
* Added "fast" version of each BG/P compiler
* Added experimental scripts in test directory to run fsstats in parallel
* Kevin Harms: Added experimental utilities for loading darshan results into SQL
* Use exclusive flag when opening output file (to protect against file name collision)
* Rob Ross: updates to allow command line tools to build on Darwin
* Bug fix for pnetcdf configure problem reported by Rob Latham; darshan now always pulls in MPI_Wtime() symbol at link time

darshan-1.1.8
=============
* Added tracking of file system type and mount point for each file
* Added tracking of file size at open time (CP_SIZE_AT_OPEN)
* Moved sync cost to be counted in cumulative write time rather than cumulative metadata time
* Added sync as a separate category in darshan-job-summar.pl counters
* Bug fix to most frequent access size table in darshan-job-summary.pl
* Converted all utilities to use darshan-logutils api for reading output files
* Added backwards compatibility to darshan-logutils routines
* Kevin Harms: Added darshan-analyzer utility to summarize usage of MPI-IO, pNetCDF, HDF5, and shared files across a set of output files
* Fixed bug field listing for darshan-diff utility

darshan-1.1.7
=============
* Minor fix for a compile warning

darshan-1.1.6
=============
* Kevin Harms: bug fix for segfault in apps that use MPI_Init_thread()

darshan-1.1.5
=============
* Limit PMPI usage in library to fewer functions
* Update PMPI detection in compiler scripts to ignore functions unused by Darshan

darshan-1.1.4
=============
* Track files opened via Parallel NetCDF
* Track files opened via HDF5
* Record slowest individual POSIX read and write times along with access size for those operations
* Inspect symbols at compile time to determine whether to enable Darshan or not based on the presence of MPI and PMPI symbols
* Use GNU and IBM compilers from path rather than hard coded location
* Simplify warning message if unable to open log file
* Remove unused internal benchmark routines

darshan-1.1.3
=============
* Updated compiler scripts for V1R4 driver on BlueGene/P

darshan-1.1.2
=============
* Added *_r versions of each IBM compiler script on BlueGene/P

darshan-1.1.1
=============
* Set default permissions to 0400 (user read only) for output files
* Automatically disable Darshan at link time if common PMPI libraries are detected in the command line
* Experimental tool (darshan-gen-cc.pl) to automatically generate Darshan-enabled mpicc scripts

darshan-1.1.0
=============
* Initial public release
