# abcxyz Darshan Mod Example

This directory provides boilerplate to quickly verify and test if the wrapper
is working. Darshan has to be build with the new module enabled (see below).

Build the example library and application by issuing make:

	make

A shared object and a executeable should have been created. To run example you
can convieniently use the procedure outlined in run.sh or just call it directly
to test your wrapper:

	./run.sh

To verify if the darshan log include all expected records you can double-check
using the parser.sh file:

	./parser.sh


## Building Darshan with the new mod enabled

By default darshan-runtime will not include instrumentation for the new mod.
Therefor when configuring darshan-runtime build as follows:

	./configure CC=mpicc --with-mem-align=8 \
		--with-log-path-by-env=DARSHAN_LOG_DIR_PATH \
		--with-jobid-env=NONE --enable-abcxyz
	make -j
